# Open-Source Discovery Hub

A **self-hostable, open-source platform** for discovering useful tools, libraries, apps, and learning resources. Focused on **GitHub and trusted open-source sources**, with **local AI** for summarization, tagging, and classification. Designed to be modular, versioned, and one-click installable.

---

## Project Purpose

- Solve noisy search problem: find **useful, maintained projects** instead of trending or ad-driven content.
- Fully **open-source and forkable**, runs **locally**, no API keys required.
- AI acts only as a **helper**: summarize, tag, classify. No opinions, no recommendations.

---

## Key Features

- **Source Aggregation:** GitHub repos, curated "Awesome" lists, educational resources, certificate lists.
- **Snapshots:** Static JSON/SQLite datasets with versioning and offline usability.
- **Local AI Tasks:**
  - README summarization
  - Keyword/tag extraction
  - Maintenance status classification
  - Duplicate detection
- **Search & Filtering:** by language, license, domain, activity status, source type.
- **Web & CLI UI:** Lightweight, functional, offline-capable.
- **One-click install:** Docker / install script setup.
